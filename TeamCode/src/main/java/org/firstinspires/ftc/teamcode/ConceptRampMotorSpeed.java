/*
 * This OpMode ramps a single motor speed up and down repeatedly until Stop is pressed.

 * This code assumes a DC motor configured with the name "left_drive" as is found on a Robot.
 *
 * INCREMENT sets how much to increase/decrease the power each cycle
 * CYCLE_MS sets the update period.

 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
